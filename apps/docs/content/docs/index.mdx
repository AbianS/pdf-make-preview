description: A powerful library for PDF preview.
---

Thank you for choosing **pdf-make-previewer** to streamline your PDF visualization process. This tool provides both a CLI and a library to make previewing your PDFs fast and seamless. Below is a guide to help you get started!

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
The motivation behind **pdf-make-previewer** stems from the frustration of repeatedly having to generate and open PDFs just to visualize changes during the development process. It becomes a tedious task to modify your PDF logic, generate the file, and manually open it every single time to see the result.

**pdf-make-previewer** was built to solve this problem. Instead of generating a PDF file over and over, this tool **automatically visualizes your PDF changes in real time**. It removes the hassle and provides a smooth development experience, allowing you to focus on writing your PDF generation logic while immediately seeing the results in a live preview.
## ðŸŽ¯ CLI - Quick Setup

The **CLI** allows you to set up your project quickly and effortlessly.

```bash
npx pdf-make-previewer init
```

This command will guide you through the process of setting up your project. It will ask you a series of questions to ensure a smooth installation.


## ðŸ“„ Step 2: Update Your Configuration File

Once initialized, open the generated configuration file (`pdf-previewer.config.ts` or `pdf-previewer.config.mjs`). This is where you'll import your existing pdfmake functions and set up the logic for PDF generation.

Example:
```ts
// pdf-previewer.config.ts

import type { PdfPreviewerConfig } from "pdf-make-previewer"
import { generatePDF } from './your-pdf-functions';

const config: PdfPreviewerConfig = {
  renderPdfPreview: () => generatePDF({name: 'John Doe', age: 30}),
}

export default config
```

## ðŸš€ Step 3: Run the Preview

To start using **pdf-make-previewer**, simply run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will open a local server where you can instantly preview any changes made to your PDF generation logic. Make your edits, save the file, and the preview will automatically update in real time. ðŸ”„âœ¨

## ðŸš§ Early Stage Development & Open to Contributions ðŸš§
**pdf-make-previewer** is in its early stages of development, aimed at simplifying PDF visualization during development by offering real-time previews. While it's already useful, many exciting features and improvements are planned, including more functionality and performance enhancements to further streamline the PDF workflow. ðŸš€

The project is open-source and welcomes contributions! Whether you want to suggest features, report bugs, or contribute code, we encourage you to get involved and help shape the future of **pdf-make-previewer**. Together, we can make it an even better tool for developers working with PDFs. ðŸ’ª
